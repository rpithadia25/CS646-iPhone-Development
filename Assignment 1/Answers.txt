2. The control jumps out of the "for" loop as the condition is not satisfied.

4. x4 = 10

6. The "sin" function took 8.2% of the time (46 ms)

7. The method "description" was added to the class NSObject in iOS 2.0

8. stringWithContentsOfURL:encoding:error: OR stringWithContentsOfURL:usedEncoding:error: are to be used instead.
This method interprets the contents as Unicode if it starts with a byte-order mark (U+FEFF or U+FFFE) and as UTF-8 
if the contents begin with a byte-order mark (EFBBBF). The default C string encoding varies according to the user's 
configuration. And so one should only use this method if Unicode or UTF-8 encoding is used or if the default C
string encoding can be verified. Hence this method was deprecated in iOS 2.0

9. valueForKey:   When using key-value coding, the key should be a string.
                  If the key does not start with "@", it invokes objectForKey. If it does include "@", strips "@"
                  and invokes [super valueForKey:]

   objectForKey:  The return value can also be "nil"
